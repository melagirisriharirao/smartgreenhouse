# IoT BASED WEATHER CONTROLLED SMART GREEN HOUSE

## Introduction

Agriculture is the backbone of India’s economic activity and country’s experience during the
last 50 years has demonstrated the strong correlation between agricultural growth and economic
prosperity. There is need for new and effective technology which can improve continuously the
productivity, profitability, sustainability of modern farming systems. One such technology is
the greenhouse technology.
Since time immemorial, man has learnt how to grow plants under natural environmental condi-
tions. Man has developed methods of growing some high value crop continuously by providing
protection from the excessive cold, which is called as Greenhouse Technology. So, Greenhouse
Technology is the technique of providing favorable environment condition to the plants. It is
rather used to protect the plants from the adverse climatic conditions such as wind, cold, pre-
cipitation, excessive radiation, extreme temperature, insects and diseases.

## Motivation

If India has to emerge as an economic power in the world, India’s agricultural productivity
should equal those countries, which are currently rated as economic power of the world. Lack of
adoption of latest technologies in current agricultural system is one of key aspect for hindrance
in agricultural growth of the nation. Export of commercial crops is one of the major source of
India’s foreign economy so proper care of such valuable crops is needed.

## Objective of the project

The objective of IoT based smart weather controlled greenhouse using Raspberry Pi is to realize
a real time system which provides favorable condition for crop growth inside greenhouse. The
system should be able to automate the greenhouse and also increase the crop yield. The design
is such that the sensors and related hardware connected to the system can be accessed from
anywhere anytime via an android application using internet.
